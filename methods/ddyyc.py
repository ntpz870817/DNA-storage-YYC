Name: DDYYC(Shuang-Shuang DNA Storage Code)

Coder: HaoLing ZHANG (BGI-Research)[V1]

Current Version: 1

Function(s): (1) DNA encoding by DDYYC
             (2) DNA decoding by DDYYC.

Advantages: (1) high compressibility, maximum compressibility to 1/2 of the original data.
            (2) preventing repetitive motifs, like ATCGATCG...
            (3) increase the number of sequence changes (far exceed YYC, 5,566,277,615,616 cases), increasing data security.

                                     Make sure that Xn + Yn = 1 and Xn * Yn = 0, n is in [1, 8].

        :param support_bases: Base replenishment before official data.
                               Make sure that the count of support base must more than support spacing.
                               Make sure that the number range of each position is {0, 1, 2, 3}, reference base index.

        :param support_spacing: Spacing between support base and current base.
                                 When the support base is the front of the current base, the spacing is 0.

        :param max_ratio: The max ratio of 0 or 1.
                           When the (count/length) >= this parameter, we decide that this binary sequence is not good.
